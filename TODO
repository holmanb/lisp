Implement:
- counters (per function counters, initially)
- syscalls & ioctls
- casting (between all types)
- tab completion readline support (https://web.mit.edu/gnu/doc/html/rlman_2.html)
- improve cli (-v/-h/-c)
- recursive imports
- benchmarks
- pool allocation
- tail call optimization
- static typing?
- buddy allocator??? (for variable size data types)
- introspection/debugging (breakpoint, view lenv members)
- improve stack traces

Fix:
- debug variables in library loading?
- memory leak
